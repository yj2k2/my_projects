# my_projects
This is a repository for some projects i'm working on.

1) The "ERP" project is a program i created so that it can manage a music store. You can login as an admin or as a customer:
   - as an admin, you can view information about products, invoices, orders, customer, etc.
   - as a customer, you can order products, view your orders and invoices, etc.  
All changes are commited to the database in real time, and they are saved for another use after closing the program.

2) The "Library" project is a program i created so that it can read pdf ebooks.
It's still in development, so it lacks other functionalities such as adding, editing or deleting a book. All it can do for now is read pdfs.
I created this project so i can learn to create GUIs with a fairly simple library (CustomTkinter). That's the main thing i wanted to learn here.

3) The "Spotify and Last.fm APIs" project is a script i wrote to generate playlists based on a song i provide.
Essentially, it takes a songs and uses the Last.fm API to get siumilar songs, and then search for them in Spotify and add them to a newly created playlist.
I created the script to learn how to use APIs (this is my first), therefore it's not complete and i plan to add other features.
