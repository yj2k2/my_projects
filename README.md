# my_projects
This is a repository for some projects i'm working on.

1) The "ERP" project is a program i created so that it can manage a music store. You can login as an admin or as a customer:
   - as an admin, you can view information about products, invoices, orders, customer, etc.
   - as a customer, you can order products, view your orders and invoices, etc.  
All changes are commited to the database in real time, and they are saved for another use after closing the program.

2) The "Library" project is a program i created so that it can read pdf ebooks.
It's still in development, so it lacks other functionalities such as adding, editing or deleting a book. All it can do for now is read pdfs.
I created this project so i can learn to create GUIs with a fairly simple library (CustomTkinter). That's the main thing i wanted to learn here.
